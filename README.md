# Image-Enhancement-using-Adaptive-Histogram-Equalization-AHE-in-MATLAB
This GitHub repository contains a MATLAB implementation of image enhancement techniques using Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE). AHE is a widely used method for improving the contrast and enhancing the details in digital images. 

Features:
- Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE): The repository provides a MATLAB script that applies AHE to an input image, enhancing its contrast by redistributing the pixel intensities based on local image statistics. This helps reveal hidden details and improve visual quality.

- Parameters Tuning: The script allows users to adjust various parameters such as the block size and contrast limiting factor, enabling fine-tuning of the enhancement process to suit different image characteristics and user preferences.

- Image Evaluation: The repository includes evaluation metrics for assessing the effectiveness of the AHE method in enhancing images. These metrics provide quantitative measures of contrast improvement and detail enhancement, allowing users to objectively compare different settings and algorithms.

- Sample Images: A set of sample images is provided, allowing users to quickly test the AHE implementation and observe its effects on various types of images. These images cover medical images 

- Documentation: The repository includes a detailed README file that relevant references and resources are provided for further learning about image enhancement techniques and related topics.

We encourage contributions from the open-source community to enhance this project further. Whether it's optimizing the code, adding new features, or proposing alternative algorithms, your contributions are highly appreciated.

Please refer to the documentation for usage instructions and licensing details.

Enjoy exploring and enhancing your images with Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) in MATLAB!
